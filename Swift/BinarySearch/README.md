#  Launching test cases

Run the following command in a terminal
```
$> ./launch_test_for_file.sh <FILE_NAME>
```

Make sure `launch_test_for_file.sh` can be executed
If not, make it so using `$> chmod +x launch_test_for_file.sh`

`<FILE_NAME>` is the name of the file that implements the kata, for example `binary_search_001.swift`
